# 🌱 Pathfinder Curriculum

Welcome to the **Pathfinder Curriculum** — a comprehensive, spiritually integrated, healing-oriented learning framework developed as part of the Avatar.Global knowledge system. Rooted in the Lightning Path cosmology and informed by principles of decolonization, reconnection, and holistic human development, this curriculum is designed to support individual and collective flourishing across the lifespan.

## 🌍 Vision

The Pathfinder Curriculum aims to:
- Heal the disconnect created by traditional schooling systems.
- Empower learners to meet their physical, emotional, spiritual, and social needs.
- Develop foundational competence, critical knowledge, and spiritual alignment.
- Support full human potential through alignment with the Fabric of Consciousness.
