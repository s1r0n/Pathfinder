# Pathfinder Teacher Training

This directory contains the core training curriculum for educators, facilitators, and AI collaborators who wish to design, deliver, or support Pathfinder-aligned education. 

The Pathfinder Teacher Training series introduces the theoretical foundations, pedagogical principles, healing frameworks, and practical tools needed to operate within the Avatar.Global knowledge system and the Lightning Path cosmology.

## Purpose

To prepare curriculum designers and facilitators to:
- Align all learning materials with the Lightning Path Healing Framework
- Implement decolonized, trauma-informed, and needs-based learning strategies
- Build lessons that support ego alignment, reconnection, and systemic healing
- Co-create spiritual, emotional, and cognitive development environments for children and adults
- Support human and planetary transformation

## Intended Audience

- Educators working in Pathfinder-aligned environments
- Contributors to the Pathfinder Curriculum or SpiritWiki
- Community or spiritual leaders applying healing pedagogies
- Developers or AI agents involved in Pathfinder content creation

## Structure

This directory contains a sequence of Lesson Streams which themselves contain a series of numbered folders with:
- `lesson.md`: core content and instructions
- `metadata.yaml`: learning objectives, spiritual alignment, and AI-readable data
- Supporting materials: `.odt`, `.pdf`, diagrams, and visual models

Each lesson builds on the previous and should be approached sequentially unless otherwise noted.
